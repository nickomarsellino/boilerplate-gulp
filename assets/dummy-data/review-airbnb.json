        "description": "Wow! What a magical place. The stars, the hot tub, the peace of the desert; it was a great end to our honeymoon.  I really would love to come back and spend a few more days here.  Everything I could need was provided, the house was clean and roomy, and I loved the way the house was laid out. I told my new wife that I wouldn't mind living in house just like it. It was the desert though that stole the show. Setting in the hot tub, talking to my wife, and looking up at STARS was amazing. I wanted to stay up all night and just take in everything, but regrettably had a long drive back to Oklahoma the next day. I highly recommend a stay here and I suggest that you stay for a few days if able. If you love nature, peace, and sharing a night with those near and dear to you, you couldn't hope for a better place than Joshua Tree 1954 Homestead. Thank you Leafe & Katherine. :)",

This is a great location in Boulder, access to a lot on foot. He also made us feel comfortable using the kitchen, bathroom, whatever! Thanks, Stewart",
